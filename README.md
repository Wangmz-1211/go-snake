## Project Structure

```
cell.go
game_commands.go
game_food.go
game_info.go
game_map.go
game_snake.go
go-snake
go.mod
go.sum

```

### Files and Their Responsibilities

- **cell.go**: Manages the individual cells of the game map.
- **game_commands.go**: Defines the commands for moving the snake and handling game logic.
- **game_food.go**: Manages the food items in the game.
- **game_info.go**: Contains the `GameInfo` struct and related functions for managing game state.
- **game_map.go**: Manages the game map.
- **game_snake.go**: Contains the `GameSnake` struct and related functions for managing the snake.
- **go.mod**: Go module file.
- **go.sum**: Go dependencies checksum file.
- **key_binding.go**: Manages key bindings for controlling the snake.
- **main.go**: The main entry point of the application.
- **position.go**: Defines the `Position` struct used for coordinates in the game.
